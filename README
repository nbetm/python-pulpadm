PulpAdm is a CLI tool that helps you manage your RPM repositories in a Pulp
Server (usually the master). It was initially developed with the idea of filling
the void of doing repetitive tasks around RPM repositories in the commonly known
`pulp-admin` that comes with Pulp.

Pulp is a platform for managing repositories of content, such as software
packages, and pushing that content out to a large number of consumers. For more
information, check out the project [website][pulp-home].

*Notice: this application does not implement (I'm not trying to reinvent the
wheel here) a full admin interface for Pulp. If you are looking for a full admin
client interface, use `pulp-admin` instead.*

PulpAdm comes with a CLI Interface called: `pulpadm`. Use the `-h` flag to learn
more about it and what it can do.
